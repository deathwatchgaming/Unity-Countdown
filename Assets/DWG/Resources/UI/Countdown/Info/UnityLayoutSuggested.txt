Things to change. Perhaps you may adjust more as you personalize this further
fopr your specific usages....


Having 2(X) Game Tab(s) and Scene Tab(s) may be one part that may be taking
some getting used to and is not placed there to say use Middle (Top) and
Middle(Bottom) on same tabs at same time. I add these simply so one can
transition top and bottom depending on tasks at hand. Also note: I tend to
prefer Game tab Displayed Middle (Top) and the second scene tab displayed
Middle (Bottom) by default for this layout and vis versa on transition as
simply put, having 2(X) for each tab allows you transition while say viewing
some other tabs and such when needed.


Also, since I am currently restricted to dev work using an older smaller
screen 13" MBP currently due to budgetary constraints, I tend to work both
within the constraints of that small screen when needed and then also when
possible simply hook the old small laptop up to a hdmi tv and use such as a
secondary display for unity while using the comp screen for ide / code
editor, etc, etc, thus the reason for my next suggestion: being that I make 2
variations of this layout: one for when I am using on small screen and one
with similar layout but for when using on my hdmi tv screen. 

Also note: simply that by the way I have things setup for Middle (Top) and
Middle (Bottom), that this is handy so I can simply at times drag resize one
down larger and up smaller or up larger and udown smaller when needs
require.

Ie: 

MySSLayout 
MyTVLayout 

Hopefully that all makes sense. :)
