# Unity-Countdown


CountDown (Text Legacy) & (Text Mesh Pro)
-----------------------------------------

Description:

Primarily, this simple script simply allows you to add a visible display CountDown in your scene UI Canvas via TextMeshPro (TMP) or Text (Legacy) that counts down seconds to completion and then at the end of said countdown to do something if you choose to define something to do or not. For example we switch scenes but this can be anything you want, and this example part can be commented out if not desired. 


 Simple manual setup details can be found in the DIR: "Info" via ReadMeLegacy.txt & ReadMeTMP.txt

 TestStuff Controller
-------------------------


 Note: while this was included in this repo, it has now been removed from this repository and placed in its own repo found at:

Description:

 Most example instructions need some sort of "test plane / terrain" and a "characterController" to test things out, thus one would not be able to test such if they do not already have one to test stuff with. As such, provided here is just a simple 
 "tester controller" provided for testing stuff if the end-user needs such and does not already have something.
