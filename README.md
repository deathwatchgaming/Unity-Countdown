# Unity-Countdown
 Primarily, this simple script simply allows you to add a visible display CountDown in your scene UI Canvas via TexMeshPro that counts down seconds to completion and then at the end of said countdown to do something if you choose to define something to do or not. For example we switch scenes but this can be anything you want, and this example part can be commented out if not desired.
